"""Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction, implemented from scratch (no Poisson/marching-cubes API).

Kazhdan, Bolitho, Hoppe, "Poisson Surface Reconstruction", SGP 2006;
Kazhdan & Hoppe, "Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction", ACM TOG 2013.

Pipeline (all our own code; numpy/scipy/torch arithmetic only):
 1. oriented normals: PCA + MST propagation (surface/common/normals.py, our implementation);
 2. density-adaptive sample weights and splatting of the inward normal field -n into a vector field V
    on a regular grid (trilinear splat + [1,2,1] smoothing ~ quadratic B-spline filter);
 3. divergence of V and Jacobi-preconditioned CG solve of the screened Poisson system
        (-L + beta * S^T W S) chi = -div V + beta * S^T W c,
    where L is the 7-point Laplacian (chi = 0 on the grid boundary), S trilinear interpolation at the
    samples and c the iso-value of the unscreened solution; coarse-to-fine (cascadic multigrid) warm starts;
 4. iso-surface chi = mean chi(samples), extracted with our own marching tetrahedra (Kuhn 6-tet split,
    welded edge vertices -> watertight, consistently oriented);
 5. density-based trimming (cf. PoissonRecon's SurfaceTrimmer): drop faces far from every input sample,
    then tiny components.

# =====================================================================================================
# HOW TO READ THIS FILE
#
# The idea in one paragraph: we look for a 3D function chi ("indicator") that is ~1 inside the object
# and ~0 outside. Its gradient is zero everywhere except at the surface, where it points INWARD
# (= minus the surface normal). So the oriented normals tell us what grad(chi) should look like.
# Asking "which chi has a gradient closest to these arrows?" (least squares) gives the Poisson
# equation  laplacian(chi) = div(V).  We solve it on a 3D grid, then cut out the surface where chi
# crosses a threshold (the "iso-value").
#
# Reading order (search for the "STEP" labels):
#   main()                  STEP 0  read points, get normals, call reconstruct, trim, save
#   reconstruct()           STEP 1  fit cloud into the grid, density weights, coarse->fine solves
#   solve_level()           STEP 2  build the equation at one grid size and solve it
#     _corners/splat/interp         helpers: points <-> grid (trilinear weights)
#     smooth121                     helper: blur the arrow field
#     neg_laplacian/divergence      helpers: the two differential operators
#     pcg()                 STEP 3  the iterative solver (conjugate gradient)
#   marching_tetrahedra()   STEP 4  turn the solved 3D field chi into triangles
#   trim()                  STEP 5  remove the "balloon" surface where there were no input points
#
# Notation used in the comments:  R = grid size per axis (e.g. 256), N = number of input points,
# S = interpolation grid->points, S^T = splat points->grid, W = per-point weights.
